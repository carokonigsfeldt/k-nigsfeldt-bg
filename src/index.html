    <h1 class="headline">A Child of Kashmir’s War
Grows Up to Document It</h1>
<p class="body">Showkat Nanda grew up hard in Indian-run Kashmir, a child of war, iron-fisted rule and relentless tragedy.</p>
<p class="body">He was seven years old in 1989 when rebels — some in their teens, some barely out of them — mounted an insurgency against the standing army that ran their lives. Soon Pakistan, which had been locked in a battle with India over Kashmir ever since the two became separate, sovereign nations in 1947, joined the insurgents. Mayhem ensued.</p>

<p class="body">Within a year, Mr. Nanda lost a brother and a cousin. His 17-year-old brother died trying to cross the otherworldly mountain passes across the Line of Control, the de facto border to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, while he, like thousands of young men, was seeking to train to fight the Indian forces. Three months earlier, his 16-year-old cousin had been throwing stones at government forces when they shot him dead.</p>

<p class="body">War made him a photographer. Mr. Nanda had discovered a knack for the camera as a boy when he borrowed a film SLR and taught himself how to use it. Had he grown up in another time and place — one where who died, who disappeared and who lost a limb or an eye was not the daily reality — photography might have become a hobby. He had dreamed of becoming a surgeon, after all, a likely profession for a good student from a middle-class, educated family. But he had seen too much. Mr. Nanda studied documentary photography (he has master’s degrees from the University of Kashmir and, thanks to a Fulbright Fellowship, from the University of Missouri) and made it his life’s goal to tell the untold stories of his homeland.</p>

<p class="body">“The Endless Wait” is a project that Mr. Nanda could say he has been gathering string on for most of his life. It focuses on the effect of enforced disappearances as men suspected of rebel activity or who knows what were snatched from their beds, the markets and the streets during the conflict’s last 26 years, never to be seen again.</p>

<p class="body">“Enforced disappearance” is a tactic used in conflicts all over the world, but the vanishing of thousands of men in the villages Mr. Nanda has traveled through have received little attention outside Kashmir. Human rights groups place the numbers at 6,000 to 8,000. International and local human rights groups have found 2,700 graves in North Kashmir alone, some with more than one body. Most families have never found their loved ones, so even with the occasional news of more graves, they continue to hold out hope.</p>
